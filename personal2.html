    <h3><em>My Hobbies & Interests</em></h3>

    <p>My hobbies include outdoor activities from running or working out to taking a hike. I am really into
      fitness and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I also love to dance which is why I never miss a Zumba class.
      I enjoy reading and staying up to date with everything that's trending. I love traveling and seeing new places.
      I feel like talking to different people and learning about their culture really makes a person mindful of what true
      happiness is. </p>

      <h3><em>Future Goals</em></h3>
      <p>Through my own research and practice, I've developed an interest in learning how to code and create dynamic websites.
      My main goal at the moment is to transform into a developer and have a career I'll enjoy.  </p>
