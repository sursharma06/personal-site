      <h3><em>Background</em></h3>
      <img src="arabic.png" height="70" width="200" alt="My name in Arabic">
      <p>I was born in New Delhi, India and at the age of 3, my family relocated to Dubai, UAE.
        As far as I can remember, my childhood is filled with funny memories. Growing up in a different country allowed
        me to be surrounded with people of different backgrounds and languages. I remember learning Arabic from 1st grade
        up until 8th grade. </p>


        <p>I remember being 12 years old when my parents broke the news to me about moving to New York. I was so happy to find
          out that I was going to move to the city of dreams and that I'll have the opportunity and freedom to be what I was always
          meant to be in life. It was bittersweet having to leave Dubai where I grew up and start a new life. Moving to the US came
          with it's own challenges. It was a culture shock for my whole family and not knowing the language really well was hard on me. </p>

          <p> After high school, I went on to college not having a clear picture in mind as to what I wanted to be. I felt lost in the crowd
            and even though I did well in my chosen major at the time, it definitely wasn't where my heart was. After working in a career field
            where I knew I did not belong, I've finally gotten the courage to take a leap of faith and pursue a new passion. A passion for coding.</p>

            <p>It took me a few months of research and reading articles on where to start since it is a completely new career option for me. I
              started out with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank" title="Codecademy's website"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a> courses on
              HTML and CSS. I loved learning computer-speak and being able to get an output right away felt rewarding. I took a prep course in JavaScript which
              really helped solidify my decision to pursue web development.</p>

          <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/11sBLVxNs7v6WA" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p> This is how I
            felt when I got accepted to Galvanize and I feel like I've chosen the correct curriculum for me. I am really excited to begin the Web Development program at
            Galvanize. I'm ready to take on the challenges that will come during the learning process and grow as a developer. I am also looking forward to meeting new people
            and working together as a team.</p>
